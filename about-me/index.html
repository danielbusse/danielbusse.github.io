                            Thanks for checking out my little website. I'm Daniel, a <span class="fst-italic">software engineer</span> with a 
                            <span class="fst-italic">Bachelor's degree in Telematics</span>, currently pursuing a Master's degree in the same field.
                        </p>

                            I love to be creative! And I express my creativity by making music, video game development and conceptualizing. I also enjoy 
                            doing team sports. The emphasis on teamwork in sports is more important to me than competition. Sports I like to play are volleyball, 
                            football (soccer) and many more — it's always fun to learn something new. Every summer, I volunteer as staff at an english 
                            camp for teenagers in a rural region of Brandenburg, as well as multiple reunions throughout the year amongst the same community.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-block mb-4">
                            I am a logical and strategic thinker. I like to play video games of different genres but mostly with strategic elements.
                            I have a high interest in understanding things and ideas better and the relationships and connections between them. I am 
                            eager to learn more and love exchanging ideas and thoughts with others, exploring multiple perspectives to gain a deeper understanding.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-block mb-4">
                            Music is my longest-running passion. I've been playing guitar since primary school and still jam with others regularly. Besides guitar I 
                            like playing other instruments like piano and drums, even though I'm not an expert with them. And like most people, I love listening 
                            to music and discussing it with others.
                        </p>

                            Game development is my personal coding adventure. This multidisciplinary field of engineering leaves so much room for creative ideas 
                            and experimentation. I love being able to pack emotions, ideas, relationships and fun into a singular medium.
